# LC0095: UsePartialRecordsOnRead

## Purpose

Recommends using `SetLoadFields` (or `AddLoadFields`/`SetBaseLoadFields`) before read operations on local record variables. Without partial records, the runtime loads ALL normal fields including those from table extensions, causing unnecessary SQL joins and 2-9x slower data access.

## Diagnostic properties

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | `LC0095` |
| Category | Performance |
| Severity | Info |
| Enabled by default | true |
| MessageFormat | `Use SetLoadFields before '{0}.{1}()' to improve performance by loading only the fields that are needed.` |
| Version gate | `Spring2021OrGreater` (SetLoadFields introduced in runtime 6.0, BC17) |

## Design decisions

These decisions were made during the initial design and should be preserved unless explicitly revisited:

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Phase 1: local variables only | Global variables require cross-method analysis; deferred to Phase 2 |
| Function pass | Suppress on ANY function/event pass (including built-in methods like PAGE.Run) | Conservative: avoids false positives when the callee might access any field |
| Temporary tables | Skip | No SQL Server backing, no table extension join benefit. Matches AA0242 behavior |
| Severity | Info | Performance suggestion, not a correctness issue |
| Field access required | No (report on read operation alone) | User preference; may generate noise on patterns like `if Rec.Get(Key) then` |
| RecordRef | Included | Skip temp/table-type checks (not statically determinable for RecordRef) |
| Record table type | Normal only | Skip CDS, Exchange, temporary, and other non-SQL table types |
| RecordRef.SetTable(Record) | Link suppression to target Record | If target has write ops, passed to function, load fields, or is non-local/unresolvable: suppress RecordRef. Only simple overload (1 arg). |
| RecordRef.SetTable(Record, Boolean) | Out of scope | ShareTable overload not handled; revisit if users report false positives |
| RecordRef.GetTable | Out of scope | Reverse direction; only SetTable for now |

## Architecture

### Registration strategy

Uses `RegisterCodeBlockAction` (not `RegisterOperationAction`) to analyze entire method/trigger bodies in a single pass. This avoids redundant walks when multiple read operations exist on the same variable.

### Analysis flow

1. Extract local variables of type `Record` (non-temp, Normal table) or `RecordRef` from `IMethodSymbol.LocalVariables`
2. Get `IOperation` tree from the code block via `SemanticModel.GetOperation(body)`
3. Walk with `SetLoadFieldsWalker` (extends `OperationWalker`), tracking per-variable:
   - `ReadLocations`: Get, Find, FindFirst, FindLast, FindSet calls
   - `HasLoadFieldsCall`: SetLoadFields, AddLoadFields, SetBaseLoadFields present
   - `HasWriteOp`: Insert, Modify, ModifyAll, Delete, DeleteAll, Rename, TransferFields, Init, Copy
   - `PassedToFunction`: Variable appears as argument to ANY invocation, or a non-built-in method is called ON the variable
4. Report at each read location where none of the suppression conditions are met
5. For RecordRef variables with `SetTable(TargetRecord)` calls: suppress if any target is unresolvable, non-local, or has a suppression condition (write op, passed to function, load fields)

### Key implementation detail: argument checking

The walker checks ALL invocations (both built-in and user-defined) for tracked variables in arguments. This is necessary because built-in methods like `PAGE.Run(PageId, Record)` pass the record to a page that will access its fields. The `GetVariableNameFromArgument` method only matches direct variable identifiers (e.g., `Item` in `PAGE.Run(PAGE::"Item Card", Item)`), not field access expressions (e.g., `MyTable."No."` in `SetRange`), so this doesn't cause false positives on record method arguments.

## Known issues and workarounds

### BoundObjectAccess InvalidCastException

The SDK's `OperationExtensions.GetSymbol()` throws `InvalidCastException` when the operation instance is a `BoundObjectAccess`. This type reports `Kind = FieldAccess` but doesn't implement `IFieldAccess`, so the SDK's internal cast fails. The analyzer uses a `TryGetSymbol()` wrapper that catches `InvalidCastException` and returns null.

This is an SDK bug. If a future SDK version fixes it, the try-catch becomes a no-op (harmless to keep).

## Method classification

### Read methods (trigger diagnostic)
`Get`, `Find`, `FindFirst`, `FindLast`, `FindSet`

### Load fields methods (suppress diagnostic)
`SetLoadFields`, `AddLoadFields`, `SetBaseLoadFields`

### Write/mutation methods (suppress entire variable)
`Insert`, `Modify`, `ModifyAll`, `Delete`, `DeleteAll`, `Rename`, `TransferFields`, `Init`, `Copy`

## Relationship to AA0242

AA0242 (CodeCop's `Rule0242PartialRecordsDetectJitLoads`) is the **complement** to LC0095:

- **AA0242**: Fires when `SetLoadFields` IS present but accessed fields are missing from it (detects JIT loads)
- **LC0095**: Fires when `SetLoadFields` is entirely absent (recommends adding it)

## Phase 2 roadmap (not yet implemented)

- **Global variables**: Analyze all methods in the object; check access modifiers (protected variables can't use SetLoadFields from outside); detect writes across any method
- **Parameter variables**: Analyze calling context to determine if the parameter is used only for reading
- **Cross-procedure tracing**: Track record variables passed by `var` reference through call chains
- **RecordRef enhanced**: Resolve the opened table at compile time when possible
- **SetBaseLoadFields/AddLoadFields recommendations**: Separate rule for recommending one over the other

## Test coverage

40 test cases organized as:

### HasDiagnostic (7 cases)
| Test case | Scenario |
|---|---|
| LocalRecordGet | Basic Get() without SetLoadFields |
| LocalRecordFindFirst | FindFirst() |
| LocalRecordFindSet | FindSet() + Next loop |
| LocalRecordFindLast | FindLast() |
| LocalRecordFind | Find() |
| LocalRecordMultipleReads | Multiple read ops on same variable (both should report) |
| LocalRecordRefFindFirst | RecordRef FindFirst() |

### NoDiagnostic (22 cases)

| RecordRefSetTableWithModify | RecordRef.Get() + SetTable(MyTable) + MyTable.Modify() |
| RecordRefSetTablePassedToFunction | RecordRef.Get() + SetTable(MyTable) + MyTable passed to function |

### HasFix (11 cases)
| Test case | Scenario |
|---|---|
| SingleField | One field accessed, inserts SetLoadFields with that field |
| MultipleFields | Two fields accessed, inserts SetLoadFields with both (sorted alphabetically) |
| QuotedFieldName | Field with spaces, properly quoted in SetLoadFields |
| NoFieldAccess | No field access found, falls back to primary key fields |
| SetRangeFieldExcluded | SetRange(F1, 'A') + exit(F2): only F2 in SetLoadFields (F1 is filter selector) |
| SetFilterFieldExcluded | SetFilter(F1, '%1', 'A') + exit(F2): only F2 in SetLoadFields |
| SetRangeValueArgIncluded | SetRange(F1, MyTable.F2): F2 included (value arg is consumed) |
| AllFieldsInFilters | SetRange(F1) + SetRange(F2) only, no consumed fields: falls back to PK |
| TestFieldIncluded | TestField(F1, 'X') + exit(F2): both F1 and F2 included (TestField consumes) |
| SetCurrentKeyExcluded | SetCurrentKey(F1) + exit(F2): only F2 in SetLoadFields |
| MixedFilterAndConsume | SetRange(F1, 'A') + exit(F1 + F2): both included (F1 consumed in exit) |

## CodeFix: UsePartialRecordsOnReadCodeFixProvider

### Purpose

Provides a QuickFix "ALCops: Add SetLoadFields" that inserts a `SetLoadFields` call immediately before the read operation, pre-populated with only the fields whose values are actually consumed in the method body. Fields used solely as selectors in filter/metadata methods (e.g., `SetRange`, `SetFilter`, `SetCurrentKey`) are excluded.

### Design decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Record variables only (not RecordRef) | RecordRef.SetLoadFields takes integer field numbers, not statically determinable |
| No field access case | Primary key fields as fallback | Establishes the partial records pattern; PK fields are always loaded |
| Field detection | In the CodeFix via SemanticModel | Zero analyzer overhead; `Document.GetSemanticModelAsync()` is available |
| Field ordering | Alphabetical (case-insensitive) | Deterministic output regardless of source order |
| Field filtering | Normal fields only | Skip FlowField, FlowFilter, Blob (SetLoadFields returns false for these) |
| Insertion position | New statement before the read operation's containing statement | Matches MS docs conventions |
| Filter field exclusion | Built-in methods only | User-defined methods already trigger PassedToFunction suppression in the analyzer |
| Exclusion approach | Override VisitInvocationExpression, selectively visit arguments | Clean, avoids fragile skip-set patterns; extensible via HashSets |
| Value args in filter methods | Still collected if they're field accesses | `SetRange(F1, MyTable.F2)` should include F2 since F2's value is consumed |
| All-filters fallback | Falls back to PK fields | Consistent with existing no-field-access behavior |

### Field selector exclusion in FieldAccessCollector

The `FieldAccessCollector` overrides `VisitInvocationExpression` to detect built-in Record methods that use field references as selectors rather than value consumers. Two categories:

**FirstArgFieldSelectorMethods** (exclude arg[0] only, visit remaining args normally):

| Method | Why excluded |
|---|---|
| `SetRange` | Arg 0 = filter field, args 1-2 = filter values (WHERE clause) |
| `SetFilter` | Arg 0 = filter field, rest = filter expression |
| `GetRangeMin` | Arg 0 = field selector, returns filter range |
| `GetRangeMax` | Arg 0 = field selector, returns filter range |
| `GetFilter` | Arg 0 = field selector, returns filter string |
| `SetAscending` | Arg 0 = field selector, arg 1 = boolean |
| `FieldCaption` | Arg 0 = field selector, returns metadata |
| `FieldName` | Arg 0 = field selector, returns metadata |
| `FieldNo` | Arg 0 = field selector, returns metadata |
| `HasFilter` | Arg 0 = field selector, returns boolean |
| `FieldActive` | Arg 0 = field selector, returns boolean |

**AllArgsFieldSelectorMethods** (exclude all arguments):

| Method | Why excluded |
|---|---|
| `SetCurrentKey` | All args are key fields for sorting |
| `AddLoadFields` | All args are field selectors for loading |
| `LoadFields` | All args are field selectors for JIT load |
| `AreFieldsLoaded` | All args are field selectors for checking |

**Value-consuming methods (NOT excluded, fields collected normally):**

| Method | Why included |
|---|---|
| `TestField` | Reads current field value to compare/validate |
| `FieldError` | May include field value in error message |

### Architecture

1. **CodeFix receives** the diagnostic span
2. **Gets SemanticModel** via `document.GetSemanticModelAsync()` (proven pattern from PossibleOverflowAssigning CodeFix)
3. **Resolves the variable** and record type from the invocation instance
4. **Walks the operation tree** with `FieldAccessCollector` (OperationWalker) to find consumed Normal fields on the variable
5. **FieldAccessCollector** overrides `VisitInvocationExpression` to skip field-selector arguments in known built-in methods
6. **Falls back to PK fields** when no consumed field accesses are found
7. **Sorts fields alphabetically** for deterministic output
8. **Builds** `Record.SetLoadFields(Record.Field1, Record.Field2)` syntax using `SyntaxFactory`
9. **Inserts** before the read statement using `root.InsertNodesBefore()`
